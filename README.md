*Note 2: Just before the time was about to run out, we found a bug. If the cat is not moving, just click the pause button and resume the game from pause menu, thanks :)*

## About the Game

**Screaming Pussies** is an experimental Unity game that uses your voice to control a cat lost in a maze. We started to develop this game as a project for Boot.dev Hackathon 2025.
This unique gaming experience pushes the boundaries of conventional gameplay by incorporating voice-based mechanics that directly respond to the player's voice pitch.
When we were creating this game, the main idea was fast Fourier transform and its usage. This game leads the player to practice voice pitch regulation and can act as an engaging breathing exercise.
It aims to motivate players to think about the way work with their voice and breathing, possibly leading them to discover various breathing techniques which help people achieve calmness and self-recognition.
Thanks to that, those techniques can be helpful to people struggling with anxiety, alleviating immediate symptoms both through breathing exercise and engagement in a fun, captivating activity.
We would also like to take this opportunity to raise awareness about anxiety, a widespread issue which many people are confronted with.

## The Concept

This game is intentionally **unhinged** - it challenges players to confront their anxieties through unconventional voice-driven gameplay.
The core mechanic of the game revolves around the relationship between vocal input and the movement of your character, creating an immersive experience that's both therapeutic and chaotic.
You will move in four directions determined by your pitch as is shown in the instructions on the screen. You will need a functioning microphone.

## Controls

- **Voice Input**: Primary control method: use your *voice* to interact with the game world
- **Standard Controls**: There are no standard controls to move
- **Audio Response**: The game responds dynamically to your vocal expression

## Objective

The main goal is to navigate through different scenarios using voice commands and breathing regulation techniques.
Players must learn to control their vocal responses in order to progress through increasingly challenging levels that test both their gaming skills and emotional resilience.

## Current Status

⚠️ **Work in Progress** ⚠️

This game is currently in active development. We're continuously working on:
- Refining voice recognition mechanics
- Expanding level design
- Improving audio-visual feedback systems
- Increasing difficulties
- Create more interactions
...


## Technical Requirements
- Microphone access required
- Windows 11 recommended

*Note: This is an experimental project exploring the intersection of gaming, voice interaction, and mental health awareness.*
